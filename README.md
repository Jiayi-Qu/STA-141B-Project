## Yelp Data Analysis ##
## General Background 
Yelp data challenge is a competition held by Yelp to encourage students to come up with innovative insights of their data. The Yelp dataset released for 2017 winter challenge contains information for 144 thousand businesses. This dataset has  4.1 million reviews for these business, 1 million users and 125 thousand check-in sets. 


## Goal
- Explore the relation between the user behaviors(rating values and reviews) and business attributes. 
- Predict the user’s rating stars given the reviews they left by application of machine learning.

## Methodology 
- Natural language processing
- Data visualization 
- Geographical data analysis
- (Possible) Multi-class classification (logistic regression, KNN classification) to build predictive model 

## Data extraction 
The first thing we noticed was that the huge size of the data made difficult loading. In order to extract the data, we load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook running on an Amazon Web Service(AWS) spot instance.

## Preliminary Result
